                    <p>Bond is usually a very quiet and calm dog, who doesn't appear interested in typical dog past times, such as playing catch. Despite this, he's also a kind and brave dog who uses his precognition abilities in order to help others and especially children. Because of his size, Bond is also really intimidating whenever he needs to be, showcased when he scared a bulldog into giving Anya's gloves back. Bond is also prone to jealousy, especially towards Anya's toys. In one incident, he brutally mauled Anya's plush penguin, but ended up apologizing later.

                    <p>Bond is a large, furry and white Great Pyrenees dog with black paws which, as Anya points out, resemble Bondman's gloves. His ears are short and droopy and his eyes are small, usually bearing a gloomy expression. After being adopted by Anya, he's given a special collar with a bow tie. When Bond is wet, it can be seen that he's actually really skinny underneath all the fur.</p>
